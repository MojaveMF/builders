# Builders
Simple library for easily constructing roblox data types using the builder pattern.

Also abstracts it so you don't have to remember if a data type is an instance or not as well. (Because the inconsistency is baffling.)

## Supported Roblox Data Types
- ### OverlapParams (`OverlapParamsBuilder`)
- ### DockWidgetPluginGuiInfo (`DockWidgetPluginGuiInfoBuilder`)
- ### RaycastParams (`RaycastParamsBuilder`)
- ### TeleportOptions (`TeleportOptionsBuilder`)
- ### TweenInfo (`TweenInfoBuilder`)
